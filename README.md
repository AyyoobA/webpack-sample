What is webpack 
 - bundle large modules into single or multiple optimized modules 
 - using Babel to support older browsers with javascript incompatibility
 - internally it creates a dependency graph using the import / require statments in the js files
 - it can translate .scss to css, etc using loaders (since webpack only support javascript and json)

 - Note - in angular using the selector (internally document.getQuery()...) in component file it loads the content in index.html withing <app-root></app-root>
